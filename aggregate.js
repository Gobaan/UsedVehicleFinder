It has a 7.5 L \/ 245hp gas engine. The transmission was rebuilt at approx. 166,000 km after it was sold by the first owners a Baptist Church in Richmond. This is a non-smoking vehicle. We are the second owners and used it for 7 years for our daycare which we closed last year. We have only added about 15,000 km in the past seven years of use. The last three bench seats were replaced with new seats in 2010 as the old ones had some rips. This vehicle comes with: Front power windows and door locks, Alarm system, Air Conditioning, Tinted Windows, AM\/FM\/CD, Trailer Towing Package. No Rust, No accidents. Tires are 90 to 95% , new Starter at 133,333 km and last wheel alignment at 135,909 km. Only down side is a small dent in the rear drivers side panel and 20 years of rock chips. The car dealer which we had purchased it from removed the Church Decals with non-professional methods causing scratches and nicks in the paint.

There are some cons as the fuel gauge does not work. The shifter on the steering column shows one down from the gear position. A few details that I want the buyer to know. This van was used in my heating company for all jobs. Shelves are also inside.","car":"1996 GMC Savana 2500 Cargo","city":"chilliwack","condition":null,"crawler":"autotrade","cylinders":null,"date":null,"deadlink":null,"drive":null,"expanded":null,"fuel":null,"garbage":null,"images":["http:\/\/az413908.vo.msecnd.net\/1\/photos\/201608\/1418\/2004\/106829e4-586e-4f6c-9ef4-dcd4ea589b0d.jpg","http:\/\/az413908.vo.msecnd.net\/1\/photos\/201608\/1418\/2020\/6620018a-f47f-4666-a541-a414bf2b1b09.jpg","http:\/\/az413908.vo.msecnd.net\/1\/photos\/201608\/1418\/2024\/63a4623a-5d90-4e5c-8e76-7a1dbe6ee253.jpg","http:\/\/az413908.vo.msecnd.net\/1\/photos\/201608\/1418\/2025\/5c7b58a4-2505-4394-b37b-dad271d41e57.jpg","http:\/\/az413908.vo.msecnd.net\/1\/photos\/201608\/1418\/2026\/3bad82a3-ddb7-4845-9f94-1b7ded36c331.jpg","http:\/\/az413908.vo.msecnd.net\/1\/photos\/201608\/1418\/2027\/d2e96b1a-f7db-4cd5-89ab-572bdb380bb2.jpg"],"model":null,"odometer":589467.0,"paint color":null,"price":2500.0,"query":"Autotrader","size":null,"size \/ dimensions":null,"title":null,"title status":null,"transmission":null,"type":null,"url":"http:\/\/wwwa.autotrader.ca\/a\/GMC\/Savana+2500\/CHILLIWACK\/British+Columbia\/19_9515769_\/?ms=heavy_trucks&showcpo=ShowCPO&orup=42_100_43","value":0.0042411195},{"Accident History Report(What's This?)":null,"Address":null,"Body Type":"Truck","City Fuel Economy":null,"Colour":null,"Cylinders":null,"Date Listed":null,"Doors":"3 doors","Drivetrain":"4X4","Engine":null,"Exterior Colour":"Black","For Sale By":null,"Fuel Type":"Gasoline","Hwy Fuel Economy":null,"Interior Colour":null,"Kilometers":null,"Kilometres":"1 km","Length":null,"Make":"Chevrolet","Mfg Exterior Colour":null,"Model":"2500 Cab-Chassis","No. of Doors":null,"No. of Seats":null,"Passengers":null,"Price":null,"Status":"Used","Stock #":null,"Stock Number":null,"Style\/Trim":null,"Transmission":"Automatic","Trim":null,"Type":null,"VIN":null,"Vehicle History Report":"Request CarProof","Year":null,"body":"idk the KM'S lights burnt out!need gone before Sept going to school!truck runs good and drives good wouldn't be selling otherwise !!Txt 2508708518","car":"1999 Chevrolet 2500 Cab-Chassis","city":"kelowna","condition":null,"crawler":"autotrade","cylinders":null,"date":null,"deadlink":null,"drive":null,"expanded":null,"fuel":null,"garbage":null,"images":["http:\/\/az413908.vo.msecnd.net\/1\/photos\/201608\/1923\/2921\/20c95e83-b685-4585-9f2a-234747d6f62a.jpg","http:\/\/az413908.vo.msecnd.net\/1\/photos\/201608\/1923\/2921\/a1449db4-84d2-45d7-840e-c45f901a14b6.jpg","http:\/\/az413908.vo.msecnd.net\/1\/photos\/201608\/1923\/2920\/c97111a3-5053-4fb7-9ec0-9c3ccfc3e380.jpg"],"model":null,"odometer":1000.0,"paint color":null,"price":1500.0,"query":"Autotrader","size":null,"size \/ dimensions":null,"title":null,"title status":null,"transmission":null,"type":null,"url":"http:\/\/wwwa.autotrader.ca\/a\/Chevrolet\/2500+Cab-Chassis\/KELOWNA\/British+Columbia\/19_9545902_\/?ms=heavy_trucks&showcpo=ShowCPO&orup=43_100_43","value":1.5},{"Accident History Report(What's This?)":null,"Address":null,"Body Type":"Cube","City Fuel Economy":null,"Colour":null,"Cylinders":"10","Date Listed":null,"Doors":null,"Drivetrain":"RWD","Engine":"v10","Exterior Colour":"White","For Sale By":null,"Fuel Type":"Gas","Hwy Fuel Economy":null,"Interior Colour":"Grey","Kilometers":null,"Kilometres":"174,000 km","Length":null,"Make":"Ford","Mfg Exterior Colour":null,"Model":"E-450","No. of Doors":null,"No. of Seats":null,"Passengers":null,"Price":null,"Status":"Used","Stock #":null,"Stock Number":"7654","Style\/Trim":"Econoline","Transmission":"Automatic","Trim":null,"Type":null,"VIN":null,"Vehicle History Report":"Request CarProof","Year":null,"body":"Clover Auto Sales Ltd.\rPhone 778-293-3888\rDL 30648\r Stock #

Meet Casey Jones. She is a 1987 Dodge Camper Van B250. We had initially planned to paint her \u201cLed Zeppelin \u2013 Mothership\u201d themed but the red was too bright and we converted her into this glorious Grateful Dead van that you see before you today. I bought Casey Jones in the summer of 2012. Before then her previous owner had used her 6 times, and before them, an elderly relative let it sit in their backyard unused. She is therefore young and spritely and low on kilometers. Casey Jones has been my muse and my flame but I am looking towards the future and believe that I should sell her before I begin to travel. I have no reason to sell her other than to prepare for the future (and also I would appreciate something a bit more maneuverable) and therefore I will only let her go for the right price or for the right trade. I am however, open to negotiations based on FACTS and reason. I have kept the majority of the receipts from work done (and the estimated work that needed to be done) on the van. Ideally, I would love to trade for an older Jeep or small Toyota truck but I will absolutely consider other vehicles. Feel free to contact me at which point I can give you my phone number and address. Thank you for your time.

We are selling our lovely 1976 Ford econoline funcraft. Currently located in Fernie, BC, we are heading to the coast and will be looking to sell by October 5th in the Vancouver area or on the island. It comes equipped with a pull out bed, cd\/radio, propane 3 burner stove, electric fridge and electric water pump sink. All are in working order, however the electrical appliances only function while the van is plugged in or if you purchase a spare car battery it may be hooked up to be mobile. The van runs great, fluids are topped up. Plenty of tread on the tires. Automatic transmission. The odometer reads 26000 but rolls over at the 100000 mark - so could be more. Also comes with some lovely interior decoration! Please feel free to contact me for more information or photos. For the fastest response please call or text me.

This is a perfect base for someone wanting to complete the interior to their liking. The van is currently halfway through an interior renovation, with the interior being gutted and the new flooring and insulation installed. The original plan was to complete the renovation for a large trip but plans have since changed. I am including the following with the Van: \u2022 3-way fridge \u2022 Sink with manual and electric pump \u2022 Furnace \u2022 3 burner propane stove \u2022 New shelving\/cabinets have been built to fit and are ready to be installed. Mechanically, the vehicle is in good shape. The engine is a 5.8L V8 with 45,600km. When I bought the Van from my Grandparents in 2007 it had 34,000kms on the body and roughly 5,000km on a rebuilt engine. I just purchased a brand new battery and the valve covers were replaced. The exterior has rust and will need some work as seen in the pics, with the rear passenger wheel well being the area that needs the most attention. The van does come with an awning, which is a $500-$600 value. $1,750 obo Please text or call Dexter at 250-863-1991 if interested.","car":null,"city":"vancouver downtown west","condition":null,"crawler":"kijji","cylinders":null,"date":"2016-09-16 21:28:30","deadlink":false,"drive":null,"expanded":null,"fuel":null,"garbage":null,"images":null,"model":null,"odometer":45600.0,"paint color":null,"price":1750.0,"query":"ford-econoline","size":null,"size \/ dimensions":null,"title":"1980 Ford Econoline E150 Camper Van","title status":null,"transmission":null,"type":"rv","url":"http:\/\/www.kijiji.ca\/v-rv-motorhome\/vancouver-downtown-west-end\/1980-ford-econoline-e150-camper-van\/1198522025","value":0.038377193},{"Accident History Report(What's This?)":null,"Address":"Dawson Creek, BC V1G1J5","Body Type":null,"City Fuel Economy":null,"Colour":"White","Cylinders":null,"Date Listed":"10-Sep-16","Doors":null,"Drivetrain":null,"Engine":null,"Exterior Colour":null,"For Sale By":"Owner","Fuel Type":null,"Hwy Fuel Economy":null,"Interior Colour":null,"Kilometers":null,"Kilometres":null,"Length":null,"Make":null,"Mfg Exterior Colour":null,"Model":null,"No. of Doors":null,"No. of Seats":null,"Passengers":null,"Price":"$6,800.00","Status":null,"Stock #":null,"Stock Number":null,"Style\/Trim":null,"Transmission":null,"Trim":null,"Type":null,"VIN":null,"Vehicle History Report":null,"Year":"1987","body":"1987 Ford F350 Econoline Okanagan Motorhome, 3 new batteries, new windshield, PDI inspection done, nice shape. 250-219-9912","car":null,"city":"dawson","condition":null,"crawler":"kijji","cylinders":null,"date":"2016-09-16 21:28:35","deadlink":false,"drive":null,"expanded":null,"fuel":null,"garbage":null,"images":null,"model":null,"odometer":0.0,"paint color":null,"price":6800.0,"query":"ford-econoline","size":null,"size \/ dimensions":null,"title":"Ford Motorhome","title status":null,"transmission":null,"type":"rv","url":"http:\/\/www.kijiji.ca\/v-rv-motorhome\/dawson-creek\/ford-motorhome\/1182893772","value":null},{"Accident History Report(What's This?)":null,"Address":"Prince George, BC V2K2G9","Body Type":null,"City Fuel Economy":null,"Colour":"Blue","Cylinders":null,"Date Listed":"17-Aug-16","Doors":null,"Drivetrain":null,"Engine":null,"Exterior Colour":null,"For Sale By":"Owner","Fuel Type":null,"Hwy Fuel Economy":null,"Interior Colour":null,"Kilometers":"139,940","Kilometres":null,"Length":null,"Make":null,"Mfg Exterior Colour":null,"Model":null,"No. of Doors":null,"No. of Seats":null,"Passengers":null,"Price":"$9,000.00","Status":null,"Stock #":null,"Stock Number":null,"Style\/Trim":null,"Transmission":null,"Trim":null,"Type":null,"VIN":null,"Vehicle History Report":null,"Year":"1988","body":"1988 26 ft Ford Econoline 350 Empress Motorhome, Factory A\/C, Rear bedroom, separate toilet and shower space, forced air furnace, lots of storage space, large windows, trailer hitch,this unit has always been stored inside over the winter, one piece metal roof, no leaks, lino throughout, easy to clean very good over all condition.

It also has chrome wheels. Sliding side door with glass on it. Rear doors have glass on them as well. Inside cargo area has been boarded up with wood to prevent damage to the side walls. This van runs\/drives like new! The mileage is 260,000 original kilometers (Freeway Kilometers) but you would never guess by the way it runs\/drives. Regularly serviced on time (both by dealer &amp; other licensed shops). Very well taken care of. The tires (which were recently replaced) are probably about 85-90% (tire brand is Michelin). Rear differential rebuilt by the dealership (Carter GM) done under warranty at 82,000 kilometers, Fuel pump was replaced by the dealer ($1300), rear brakes repaired ($700), front brakes repaired ($280). Our van has a clean title and has NOT been in major accidents, however, it has been in a few minor accidents (all repaired professionally by licensed shops). This van is a must see! I can definitely say that this is probably the best van on craigslist right now as far as physical and mechanical condition. Asking $8800.

It has a 7.5 L  \/ 245hp gas engine. The transmission was rebuilt at approx. 166,000 km after it was sold by the first owners a Baptist Church in Richmond. This is a non-smoking vehicle. We are the second owners and used it for 7 years for our daycare which we closed last year. We have only added about 15,000 km in the past seven years of use. The last three bench seats were replaced with new seats in 2010 as the old ones had some rips. This vehicle comes with: Front power windows and door locks, Alarm system, Air Conditioning, Tinted Windows, AM\/FM\/CD, Trailer Towing Package. No Rust, No accidents.  Tires are 90 to 95% , new Starter at 133,333 km and last wheel alignment at 135,909 km. Only down side is a small dent in the rear drivers side panel and 20 years of rock chips.

Starts easily, A\/C works very well.<br>\n<br>\nA large, solid, heavy construction or hauling van. Runs very smooth, good pick up and very reliable.<br>\n<br>\nWork done in the last 6 months:<br>\nNew windshield<br>\nNew fuel pump in tank<br>\nComplete tune up<br>\nNew U-joints<br>\nRadiator flush<br>\nNew heater core<br>\n<br>\nThe back cargo area is insulated and covered in plywood. The wheel wells are boxed in and there is a rack and tie downs inside. Comes with an 10' steel diamond plate storage box that mounts on the top rack. It has a latching lid for security.<br>\n<br>\nI have kept it clean and mechanically sound. There are three things I haven't got to yet.<br>\n-A small squeak when it starts - needs smog pump pulley replaced or alternator replaced to align belt. <br>\n-A shallow dent in the side door (see last photo)<br>\n-Gas line drips a bit of gas if it's filled too fast. <br>\n    Replaced the fuel fill line but haven't chased down the leak.
